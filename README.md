## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I learn to add multiple background and set it custom position. It is still not perfect but I did my best. I am looking forward to learn more about proper background positioning in multiple images. 


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools- Background](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp) - This helped me adding mutiple images in background and set positioning..
